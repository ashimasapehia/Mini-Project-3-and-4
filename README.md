Mini Project 04 -
Titanic Survivors Data Exploration and Visualization
Objectives-

Understanding concepts of exploratory data analysis.
Tools and commandsrequired for exploratory data analysis
Conclusion:

We can see that amongst those who survived, maximum number of passengers had embarked at Southhampton.
Because of 25% of correlation between survived and fare, we can say that mostly passengers who survived had higher average fares i.e mainly first class passengers.
More passenger survived who were travelling alone than those travelling with friends or family.
We can observe that maximum females survived the journey. This must be mainly because, we have seen in the film as well, women and children were given preference to board the safety boats.
Maximum passengers who survived are 1st Class females while the least are 3rd class males.
